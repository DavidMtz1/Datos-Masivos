##Pearson Correlation Research##

The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is a measure of the correspondence or linear relationship between two random quantitative variables. In simpler words it can be defined as an index used to measure the degree of relationship that two variables have, both quantitative.

Having two variables, the correlation facilitates estimates of the value of one of them, with knowledge of the value of the other variable.
This coefficient is a measure that indicates the relative situation of the events with respect to the two variables, that is, it represents the numerical expression that indicates the degree of correspondence or relationship that exists between the 2 variables. These numbers vary between limits of +1 and -1.
